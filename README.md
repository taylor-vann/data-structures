#Python Practice#

##Abstract##

Algortithms and data structures in python3.

##Details##

This is technical practice with common algorithms and data structures in python3. The point is to not use built-in functions and classes and create homebrew stacks, queues, heaps, sorts, trees, and graphs. Of course, all of these endeavours are composed using test driven development.

##Usage##

Here's a bunch of boring algorithms and data structures. Cool beans.

If you're studying for your comp-sci courses you should really rely on the examples given by your professors. That's what'll give you the grade.

If your teaching yourself and just need help or a guide, this is just one more perspective. It's not intended to be a tutorial.

This is just personal practice. I love art and computation but you really need a foundation in computer-science to do either these days.

Unfortunately, considering yourself an artist creates a stigma that hinders your ability to get a technical interview let alone be taken seriously in said hypothetical interview (even if you have a solid foundation in computer science and media theory). This is one attempt to bridge that gap between creativity and professionalism. 

SLNode - Singly Linked Node

```
slnode = SLNode()
slnode = SLNode(<nextnode>, <data>)
slnode.set_data(<data>)
slnode.get_data()
slnode.set_next(SLNode())
slnode.get_next()
```

Stack - Stack class

```
stack = Stack()
stack = Stack(<data>, <data>, ...)
stack.push(<data>)
stack.pop()
stack.peek()
stack.search()
```

Queue - Queue class

```
que = Queue()
que = Queue(<data>, <data>, ...)
que.enqueue(<data>)
que.dequeue()
que.peek()
que.search()
```


SLList - Singly Linked List class

```
lst = SLList()
lst = SLList(<data>, <data>, ...)
lst.insert(<data>)
lst.insert_after(<new>, <data>)
lst.remove()
lst.remove_data(<data>)
lst.peek()
lst.search()
```
