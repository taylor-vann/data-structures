# Python Practice #

## Abstract ##

Algortithms and data structures in python3.

## Details ##

This is just some fun technical practice with algorithms and data structures in python3. The point is to not use built-in libraries. They're homebrew stacks, queues, heaps, sorts, trees, traversals, and graphs that will run without library extensions.

Of course, like every good computer science student, all of these endeavours are composed using test driven development. You are using TDD, yes? Of course you are. \*Wink \*Wink.

## Usage ##

If you're studying for your comp-sci courses, you should rely on the examples provided by your professors. That's what'll give you the grade.

If you're teaching yourself and just need an extra perspective, I hope these help.
