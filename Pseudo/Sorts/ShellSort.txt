Shell Sort Pseudo Code


shellSort(list):
  l as length of list

  if l < 2 return list

  space = l / 2 as int

  while space > 0:
      for j in space to length:
          while j - space > -1 and a[j - space] > a[j]:
              swap a[j - space] and a[j]
              j = j - space

      space = space / 2 as int

  return a
